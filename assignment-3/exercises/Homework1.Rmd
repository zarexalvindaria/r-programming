title: ANLYTC3 R Homework 1
author: YOUR NAME HERE
output: html_document
---
The due date is 3:00pm 4 Feb 2022. Submit BOTH the Knit HTML file and the Rmd file. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# create a vector with 4 numeric elements:
vec = c(4, 8, 13, 16)
# what is the sum of the elements?
a = sum(vec)
a
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# these variables are badly named! This plot could be anything.
vec2 = c(3, 3, 8, 8)
vec
plot( x = vec, y = vec2)
```

Here are some questions for you to complete:

1. Can you find the standard deviation of the vector `vec2`? (Hint: the command for standard deviation is in the self-study material for lecture 1, under "Commands that operate on vectors")

```{r}
# add your code here #
a <- sd(vec2)
a
```

2. Use the `c()` command to create a vector containing the text elements "MISM", "MSPPM", and "EPP". Call this vector `department`.

```{r}
# add your code here #

```

Questions 3-4 use the `Orange` dataset, which comes built into R. Type `?Orange` to find out about the dataset, which contains the growth history of five different trees. (This brings up a help page. It won't show up in this R markdown file) You can look at it by typing `View(Orange)` in your console window. 

3. Use subset to extract the growth records corresponding to tree number 4. Call this data set `Orange.subset`

```{r}
# add your code here #

```


4. Make a plot showing the `circumference` of tree number 4 as a function of its `age`.

```{r}
# add your code here #

```
